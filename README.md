Hi, I’m @origovi, nice to meet you 😄.

# About me
👨‍💻 I'm a spanish guy who started programming very young and has a lot of passion for the potential that software has to revolutionize society.\
🏠 I live in a town near Barcelona (Spain).\
🚴‍♂️ My favourite sport is cycling.\
🚗 I'm very interested in computer vision applied to cars.

# Studies
After completing a **Baccalaureate** oriented in science and technology with a 8.67/10 final grade, my final work already aimed to a specific field of study.
The work was about controlling a robotic arm using a Microsoft Kinect programmed using Processing and Arduino (grade 10/10).

Then, I started a **bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering** at the UPC (Technical University of Catalonia).\
I could not have chosen better, I loved everything we did!\
There, I learned:
- To program appropriately (C++)
- How a CPU works
- Communications between computers
- Assembler programming
- Designing and structuring complex software programs
- Algorithmics
- Data structures
- And a lot more!

My final degree thesis was about a system made for the Formula Student team [BCN eMotorsport](https://bcnemotorsport.upc.edu), there I was the head of the perception department for our driverless car.
My job was to ensure that our perception system had the requirements we wanted in order to run as fast as possible.
One of the proposed systems [CCAT](https://github.com/origovi/CCAT) is about creating a statistical model to sensor fuse the cameras and the LiDAR in order to obtain classified cones and keep track of them.
The other proposed system [Urimits](https://github.com/origovi/urimits) is a track limits algorithm that only takes geometrical data (position) of every cone in track to compute the track limits.

This project obtained a grade of 9.5/10.
