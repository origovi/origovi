Hi, I‚Äôm @origovi, nice to meet you üòÑ.

# About me
üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a spanish guy who started programming very young and has a lot of passion for the potential that software has to revolutionize society.\
üè† I live in a town near Barcelona (Spain).\
üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My favourite sport is cycling.\
üöó I'm very interested in computer vision applied to cars.

# Studies
After completing a **Baccalaureate** oriented in science and technology with a 8.67/10 final grade, my final work already aimed to a specific field of study.
The work was about controlling a robotic arm using a Microsoft Kinect programmed using Processing and Arduino (grade 10/10).

Then, I started a **bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering** at the [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en) (Technical University of Catalonia).\
I could not have chosen better, I loved everything we did!\
There, I learned:
- To program appropriately (C++)
- How a CPU works
- Communications between computers
- Assembler programming
- Designing and structuring complex software programs
- Algorithmics
- Data structures
- And a lot more!

My final degree thesis was about a system made for the Formula Student team [BCN eMotorsport](https://bcnemotorsport.upc.edu), there I was the head of the perception department for our driverless car.
My job was to ensure that our perception system had the requirements we wanted in order to run as fast as possible.
One of the proposed systems [CCAT](https://github.com/origovi/CCAT) is about creating a statistical model to sensor fuse the cameras and the LiDAR in order to obtain classified cones and keep track of them.
The other proposed system [Urimits](https://github.com/origovi/urimits) is a track limits algorithm that only takes geometrical data (position) of every cone in track to compute the track limits.

This project obtained a grade of 9.5/10.

# My commitment
From the experience obtained at university and in the Formula Student team, my main interest are driverless vehicles.
Autonomous driving has a lot of advantages compared to manual driving and is my desire to contribute to society with advancements in this field.
I am willing to work in the perception of vehicles, how can they see the world, learn objects and learn what to do in EVERY situation? This is the challenge.

# Another interest: Android apps
While I was in university, in my free time, I decided to learn how to program an application properly. That is because in high school, I developed two applications using [App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) and it leaved a bitterseet taste because I was not able to program everything that I wanted.

So I learned **Flutter**.\
With some of my friends from university we decided to make an app for students to make groups in class to work. It often happens that new students work alone since they do not know anyone to work with. This app [FibGroup](https://github.com/origovi/FibGroup) was developed during a hackathon called [HackUPC](https://hackupc.com/) (the largest in Spain). The app allowed students to navigate through different subjects and classes, then they can either create a group or join one (each group has a pre-defined number of people). Then the people already in the group can accept or decline new requests.

Some time after, I decided to make an app (more complex) for my Formula Student team. All info can be found in [BCNeMotorsportApp](https://github.com/origovi/BCNeMotorsportApp).
